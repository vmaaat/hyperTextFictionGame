This is a 2D side scroller game called 'Up, Up and Away!' I have hand coded using JavaScript, HTML and CSS elements. 
When the webpage is loaded up, you will be greeted with a menu screen showing a description box,
start menu and a save menu. 
Upon entering your desired player name and starting the game, the game will open and you will be
able to freely move the character around using the 'a', 'd' and 'w' keys. Feel free to explore and roam as much
as you want.
Pressing the save progress button on the main menu will save your player data onto a JSON file which will be downloaded
to the computer. This then can be imported into the save menu box and your data will be imported back into the website.

<--DESCRIPTION-->
'Up, Up and Away!' is a platformer
where players guide an exiled king
through different levels to
help him reclaim his castle!
